# CSCI 1061u - Programming Workshop 2 

## Winter 2017

### Assignment 2 - Due by Midnight Sun. Mar 5 

#### Write a matrix class.

You need to write a matrix class (`Mat`) that implements common matrix functionality.  You need use the `Mat.h` and `Mat.cpp` files to write this class.   Your `Mat` class should meet the following requirements.

##### Dynamic Matrix Allocation

~~~cpp
Mat m(10,2); // Allocates a matrix with 10 rows and 2 columns

Mat m; // creates a null matrix
       // this is a placeholder 
       // with 0 rows and 0 columns
~~~

##### Read and write from istream and ostream, respectively.

*Reading from a istream*

~~~cpp
Mat m; // creates a null matrix

cin >> m; // 1st entry is number of rows (r)
          // 2nd entry is number of colums (c)
          // r times c entries for the matrix
          //
          // note that >> first allocates
          // the matrix of the right size and 
          // then reads it in.
          // the allocation only occurs if
          // m is a null matrix.
          // otherwise in case of a mismatch an
          // error is issued
~~~

*Write from a istream*

~~~cpp
Mat m(2, 3);
ofstream f("output.mat");
f << m; // 1st entry is 2
        // 2nd entry is 3 
        // 6 entries
f.close();
~~~

##### Copy constructor and assignment operator with error checking

~~~cpp
Mat a(2,3);
Mat b(a);      // Using copy constructor
Mat c = a;     // Using assignment operator

// But the following should give an error
Mat d(10,10);
d = a;         // Not the same size
~~~

##### Scalar arithmatic

Overload the following operators for matrix-scalar (double) addition/subtraction/multiplication/division: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=`.

##### Matrix arithmatic

Overload the following operators for matrix-matrix addition/subtraction/multiplication: `+`, `-`, `*`, `+=`, `-=` and `*=`.  Don't forget to error check.  E.g., for addition or subtraction the two matrices must be the same size, and for multiplication the number of columns of the first matrix should be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix.  

*Hint: checkout matrix operations in your favourite linear algebra text book.*

##### Indexing

Overload `[]` operator to support the following functionality:

~~~cpp
Mat m(2,3);
cout << m[0][1] << endl; // prints the 0th row and 1st column entry
~~~

##### Fill up

Develop the following functions:

- Destructor to deallocate the memory;
- `Mat::ones()` to initialize a matrix to all 1s;
- `Mat::zeros()` to initialize a matrix to all 0s; and
- `Mat::rand()` to intialize a matrix to random values between 0 and 1.

#### What to submit

It is extremely important that you follow the instructions below:

- Your class should be called `Mat`
- It should be implemeted in files `Mat.h` and `Mat.cpp`. 
- A user will use your class as follows:

~~~cpp
...
#include "Mat.h"
...
int main()
{
	Mat m(2,2);
	m.ones();

	return 0;
}
~~~

- For the purposes of marking, we will compuile your code as follows:

~~~bash
$ g++ main.cpp Mat.cpp -o mat_test
~~~

- Submit only `Mat.h` and `Mat.cpp` files.
- Submit via Blackboard.
