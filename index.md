## Description

This is a second intensive course on computer programming (C++) that continues from CSCI 1060U and covers more advanced theory and practice. The lectures introduce modern concepts in program design and construction for larger scale programs. The laboratories provide an opportunity to apply these concepts. Topics that are covered in this course include advanced program design, design patterns, program refactoring, templates and standard template libraries, data structures, debugging and version control.
